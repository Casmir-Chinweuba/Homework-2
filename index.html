      <h3>About Casmir Chinweuba</h3>

      <p>
        I'm a full stack developer student with the University of Adelaide, I am
        training to start earning a living by creating custom brands and logo
        designs from scratch, as well as designing and building high quality
        websites and blogs, but I also enjoy producing the odd t-shirt graphic,
        illustration or character design. I pride myself in having the nerdy
        skills to build top notch creations online, as well as being
        knowledgeable in the print side of design.
      </p>

      <h3>My latest work</h3>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m creating design work for both myself as personal projects and as a
        hired developer for clients from around the world.
